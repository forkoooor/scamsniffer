{"collection":{"slug":"cryptomories","name":"CryptoMories","description":"\"memento mori\" means \" remember you die\" in latin. \r\nIt is an old saying used to remind people that life is short, and must be lived to the fullest.\r\nIt is very often symbolized by a skull.\r\nCryptoMories are 10 000 little skeletons here to remind you that life is good, that there are a lot of amazingly kind people, and that you are one of them. Focus on your greatness.\r\n\r\nCryptoMories are not a basic 10k generative series. They are an adaptative generative series. \r\nOne item differs from one Mori to another, depending on the type. A top hat on a zombie will have holes in it. This makes different types even more special. And it is extremely fun to try to figure out what item looks like on other types.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are many little fun games and easter eggs. Including VERY special Mories.. some might say unique..\r\n\r\nCryptoMories are the second series of the iwwon project, after the Los Samos handmade one. Both can be combine to access the handmade series vandals.
