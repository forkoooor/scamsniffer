{"collection":{"slug":"thecurrency","name":"Damien Hirst - The Currency","description":"HENI is delighted to present The Currency, the first NFT collection by Damien Hirst. Reimagining the way NFTs are used, The Currency is a collection of 10,000 NFTs which correspond to 10,000 unique physical artworks which are stored in a secure vault in the UK. The works are now brought to life through their launch on the blockchain.\r\n\r\nStarting with the creation of the physical artworks in 2016, The Currency explores the boundaries of art and currencyâ€”when art changes and becomes a currency, and when currency becomes art. Successful applicants will all initially receive NFTs. Ultimately, you have to decide between the digital NFT or the physical artwork, both of which are artworks in their own right. Whichever you pick, the other gets burned.\r\n\r\nThe collection is on the Palm blockchain, which is a new token-powered ecosystem for NFTs connected to Ethereum. It is 99% more energy efficient than proof of work systems such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. The Currency NFTs can be moved to Ethereum.","imageUrl":"https://img-ae.seadn.io/https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2FQ3G1qQKz97idjTwIJB9Enz3D4LDvL_DbwnHCP9YgVjTL4TLh7tAWUwGLPExniqGlfgLXRX-bOHRgGOb7oNOAHoeQWz2-CPLwDuaHRw%3Ds10000?fit=max&h=120&w=120&auto=format&s=73aae5c8558d6b3de2e2c939cb6e2f53","connectedTwitterUsername":"HENI","assetContracts":{"edges":[{"node":{"chain":"ETHEREUM","id":"QXNzZXRDb250cmFjdFR5cGU6Mjk1MDM0","blockExplorerLink":"https://etherscan.io/address/0xaadc2d4261199ce24a4b0a57370c4fcf43bb60aa","chainData":{"blockExplorerName":"ETHERSCAN"},"address":"0xaadc2d4261199ce24a4b0a57370c4fcf43bb60aa"}}]},"contract_address":"0xaadc2d4261199ce24a4b0a57370c4fcf43bb60aa"},"tokens":[{"tokenId":4613,"firstTime":"2022-05-22T09:37:36+00:00"},{"tokenId":4119,"firstTime":"2022-05-19T03:45:46+00:00"}]}
