What can we learn from this visual representation of our split experience? Physical and digital augmentation pushes us further to question the essence of our identity in this increasingly tangible dimension of digital reality. \n\nStanding in a serene womb-like virtual oasis designed by Katie McIntyre, representing a shift of values that define power, bringing nurture and connection with the body, our planet, and wellbeing into the space of innovation in science and technology. An opportunity to rediscover a different nature of control, affirming the importance of inclusion, a chance to heal and fill the void of women's voice within the leadership landscape. \n\nCan the introduction of the feminist lens to futurism evolve a less destructive path of creation and evolve the language of design with an intention of symbiosis?  \n \nViktoria has spent a lifetime researching the boundaries of human identity, reimagining the physical body while trying to understand the connection of this other 'self' - the emotional body, the spiritual body, the virtual body - all of whom form a larger construct of what becoming Future Human is.  \n \nDigital fashion and prosthetics by Katie McIntyre, Ica & Kostika, and Anouk Wipprecht.","external_link":null,"asset_contract":{"address":"0xdd69da9a83cedc730bc4d3c56e96d29acc05ecde","asset_contract_type":"non-fungible","created_date":"2021-09-22T12:29:17.190425","name":"BuildABetterFuture","nft_version":"3.0","opensea_version":null,"owner":82481744,"schema_name":"ERC721","symbol":"BABF","total_supply":"0","description":"Launched
